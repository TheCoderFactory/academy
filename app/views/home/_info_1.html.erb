          <h5>What is a Boot Camp?</h5>
          <p class="left-align light">Coding Boot Camps are a brand new development in Australia but have been running successfully in the US for the past 2 years. They sprung up due to the immense need for programmers in the rapidly expanding tech industry and due to the fact that Universities and Colleges just canâ€™t produce graduates fast enough to meet the demands.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Coding Boot Camps are a spring-board for your career in the tech industry and are a time/cost efficient way to test your compatibility with a future in the world of innovation.</p>
