        <li class="collection-item">It's safe to say that Australian companies do not want to see jobs going overseas, but if our graduates can't keep up with their Silicon Valley counterparts, then it's inevitable we'll see more entrepreneurs either starting their software companies in Silicon Valley or hiring the majority of their software developers outside Australia.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">In the US, there will be 1 MILLION more software developer jobs than computer science graduates by 2020. Computer programming jobs are growing at 2x the national average. In Australia, unis can’t churn out CS grads fast enough to meet industry demand.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">From startups to Fortune 100 companies, there is consistent demand for developers who write high-quality code, and experienced problem solvers who design creative solutions. Bottom line is: every company nowadays needs a developer like you!</li>

        <li class="collection-item">There is an insatiable demand for web developers around the globe. You don’t need to be an industry insider to realise that Australia is desperately seeking software developers. Salaries in the IT sector have never been better, and job ads become more plentiful each day. That’s why we promise to be by your side until you land your first job as a developer.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">Between a portfolio, internship experience, and skillset upon graduating, you’ll have more than enough to flaunt your development expertise to potential employers. But, our instructors also mentor students in the latest hiring process skills, interview coding challenges.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">In addition to our expert instructors, industry-leaders drop in to speak to and engage students, answer questions about the industry, and offer insights on pursuing employment opportunities.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">Our guidance doesn’t stop at the classroom. Access our network of the best developers, companies, and entrepreneurs in Australia, who are hungry for full-stack developers specialising in the in-demand programming languages and frameworks our course teaches.</li>

        <li class="collection-item">Unlike a CS degree, bootcamps focus on real-world experience, and less on unnecessary theoretical jargon. Our course is faster and more cost-effective than university courses, especially with the option to access VET FEE-HELP.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">Australian universities are not producing workplace-ready engineers. Find comfort in knowing our intensive bootcamp course teaches the right languages, methodologies, processes, and problem solving concepts that the industry currently demands.</li>
        <li class="collection-item">Our project-based course is too applied, hands-on, and small-bite to fit easily into the traditional university curriculum. Working 40 hours a week in an immersive environment, bootcamp students cover a semester’s worth of material in only four days. Think of our program as a place where technology outruns education.</li>
